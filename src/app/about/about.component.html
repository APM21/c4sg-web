        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>So many nonprofits need technical help<br>
          So many volunteers seek technical projects<br>
          But ... why do both struggle to achieve their goals?</p>
      </div>
      <div class="solution">
        <h3>Solution</h3>
        <p>A new technical volunteering model that . . .<br>
          Encourages volunteers of all ages, experience levels, and geographic locations to contribute to nonprofit projects<br>
          Fosters a strong, supportive community within the diverse volunteer pool<br>
          Connects volunteers to nonprofits based on their skillsets and interests</p>
